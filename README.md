## About

In classic Asteroids, the player controls a spaceship and destroys as many flying asteroids as possible without getting hit. 
The spaceship moves along a 2D plane that wraps back on itself.
<br /><br />
In this variant of the classic game Asteroids, the spaceship moves on the surface of a torus, another word for a donut.
<br /><br />
This project was a fun exercise in mathematics, as I had to determine the paramaterization of the surface of a torus as well as its normals. 
This was also my first time using Unity's 3D engine to develop a game.
